# vSLAM
## Overview
This project implements a visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system using [Framework/Library], allowing real-time mapping and localization using a monocular camera.

## Features
Camera Calibration: Corrects distortions and obtains intrinsic parameters.
Feature Detection and Tracking: Detects and tracks visual features in successive frames.
Initialization: Estimates initial camera pose and initializes the map.
Mapping: Updates the map with new features and optimizes structure and camera poses.
Localization: Estimates real-time camera pose relative to the map using feature matching.
Loop Closure: Detects and closes loops to correct drift and improve accuracy.
Integration with IMU/Odometry: Integrates additional sensor data for robustness.
Visualization and Output: Visualizes results and saves map and trajectory data.
Testing and Evaluation: Evaluates system performance using benchmark datasets.
